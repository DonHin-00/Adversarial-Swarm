## 2026-02-08 - Headless UX with Single-File Dashboards
**Learning:** UX for headless backend systems can be dramatically improved by embedding a simple, dependency-free HTML/JS dashboard served directly by the API.
**Action:** Always consider adding a '/dashboard' endpoint with a single-file HTML template using CDN-based Alpine.js/Tailwind for immediate visualization of backend state.

## 2026-02-08 - Active Control in Dashboards
**Learning:** Users prefer active control over passive monitoring. Adding "Dry Run" and "Pause/Resume" buttons directly to the dashboard significantly increases its utility.
**Action:** When building dashboards, always include "Emergency Stop" and "Test Mode" controls if the system is autonomous.
