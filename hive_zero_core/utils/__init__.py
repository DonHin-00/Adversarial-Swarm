"""
Utility modules for the HIVE-ZERO system.

This module provides common utilities used across the framework:
- Logging configuration with file and console handlers
- Structured logging with consistent formatting
- Log level management for debugging and production use

The logging system creates persistent logs in the 'logs/' directory
and provides real-time console output for monitoring system behavior.
